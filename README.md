# GitHub-Based Trojan Framework

This Python script is a demonstration of a GitHub-based Trojan framework. It retrieves configuration files and Python modules from a GitHub repository, executes them, and stores results back in the repository.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python Dependencies**: Ensure the following Python packages are installed:
   - `github3.py`
   - `base64`
   - `importlib`
   - `json`

   Install `github3.py` using:
   ```bash
   pip install github3.py
   ```

2. **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**:
   - Create a PAT with the necessary permissions to access the repository:
     1. Log in to your GitHub account.
     2. Navigate to **Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Tokens (classic)**.
     3. Generate a token with the following scopes:
        - `repo` (Full control of private repositories).
     4. Copy the token and keep it secure.

---

## Configuration

To run this script, you need to set your **GitHub username** and **Personal Access Token (PAT)** in the `github_connect()` function.

### Steps:

1. Open the script and locate the `github_connect` function:
   ```python
   def github_connect():
       token = ""  # Add your Personal Access Token here
       user = ""   # Add your GitHub username here
       sess = github3.login(token=token)
       return sess.repository(user, 'bhptrojan')
   ```

2. Replace the placeholders:
   - Replace `""` in `token` with your **GitHub PAT**.
   - Replace `""` in `user` with your **GitHub username**.

Example:
```python
def github_connect():
    token = "ghp_12345EXAMPLETOKEN67890"  # Replace with your actual token
    user = "your-github-username"         # Replace with your GitHub username
    sess = github3.login(token=token)
    return sess.repository(user, 'bhptrojan')
```

## How It Works

1. The script connects to the specified GitHub repository using the provided credentials.
2. It retrieves configuration files and Python modules from the repository.
3. Executes the retrieved code and stores the results back into the repository.

---

## Example Repository Structure

Your GitHub repository should have the following structure:

```
bhptrojan/
├── config/
│   └── abc.json          # Configuration files for the Trojan
├── data/
│   └── abc/              # Folder where results are stored
├── modules/
│   └── example_module.py # Python modules to be executed
```

## Important Notes

1. **Use Secure Methods for Storing Tokens**:
   - Avoid hardcoding tokens in your script.
   - Use environment variables or `.env` files to securely manage sensitive information.
   - Example using `os.environ`:
     ```python
     import os
     token = os.environ.get('GITHUB_PAT')
     user = os.environ.get('GITHUB_USERNAME')
     ```

2. **Testing**:
   - This script is for **educational purposes** only. Use responsibly.

3. **Disclaimer**:
   - Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access and modify the GitHub repository.

## ⚠️ Important Security Warning

**Host this framework in a private GitHub repository to avoid exposing sensitive information or violating GitHub policies, which could result in your account being banned.**
